colourlovers-to-gpl
===================

Dirty scripts to get palettes from colourlovers api and transform 'em into inkscape/gimp gpl palettes.

It makes one gpl file per palette, so maybe it's not the best way to do. Fell free to fork !

Just launch get_palettes.sh :

    ./get_palettes.sh
    
You can copy the resulting files into

    ~/.config/inkscape/palettes # inkscape
    
    ~/.gimp-X.X/palettes # gimp
